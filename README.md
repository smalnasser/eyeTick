# Challenge Summary
we want to make an inclusive solution that help people in technology. The first thing that we ask ourselves was
what are the problem that people faced with technology?. unfortunately , what was surprising us is the following  fact : the technology effects our health especially the worker and student. In the other hand , Some of the users of computer technologies are not even aware of their health-related problems that they have. So , we decide to find a way which contribute to take care of health of body and senses. From this passion we start our story with eyeTick which  helps an employee  who works for long hours on computer to reduce their eye strain by following the 20 20 20 rule to rest their eyes. At the end of this challenge we so happy with all the rich information that we gain about localization and accessibility and we are so happy to Make Someone’s Life Easier. ( sarah and nourah)
